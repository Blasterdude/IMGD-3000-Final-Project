Squill SquisherDeveloped Team 203 (Thomas Meehan and Paul Orvis)“Squill Squisher” is a high-energy action game where players bounce a singular projectile around the arena in an attempt to destroy the members of an invading alien race known as “Squills”. As players progress enemies get tougher and the game moves faster, but a well-placed power up can turn the tide. Technical highlights of the game include advanced collision physics on the projectile, which enables fast yet realistic and predictable movement of the projectile as it bounces around the arena and destroys enemies. The game also features extensive audio with various sound effects and unique background tracks for each level.
